## Welcome to Q11 at Maristenkolleg

We are the 11th grade class of the Maristenkolleg high school. 

### About Us

We are students that like to code some stuff from scratch that usually doens't work in the first place.
To xsolve this issue we like to google and determine afterwards that the Stackoverflow ducussion was already outdate for several years.
Our favourite programming language is Kotlin because it's simple but yet very effective.

The code sample that defines our work the most is:
```
boolean result;

boolean getResult() {
    if (result == true) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
   
}
```

#We know, we are very proud of ourselves (:
