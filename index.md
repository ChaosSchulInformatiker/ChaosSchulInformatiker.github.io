## Welcome to ChaosSchulInformatiker (Chaos school IT guys)
We are the 12th grade class of the Maristenkolleg high school. 

### About Us

We are students that like to code some stuff from scratch that usually doens't work on the first try.
To solve this issue we like to ask Google and discover that the Stackoverflow ducussion was already outdate for several years afterwards.
Our favourite programming language is Kotlin because it's simple but yet very effective.

The code sample that defines our work the most is:
```java
boolean result;

boolean getResult() {
    if (result == true) {
        return true;
    } else if (result == false) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

We know, we are very proud of ourselves (:
